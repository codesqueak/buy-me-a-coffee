# Buy me a Coffee :coffee: ?

I'm Code Squeak and I have been building and contributing  to various OSS projects for over 20 years in my spare time (limited as it is :alarm_clock:)

If you have found anything useful and you want to support me, then Buy me a Coffee 


[buymeacoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/) is a website that contacts developers, designers, artists, etc. with their communities so that people can express appreciation  for their work.

If you want to contribute feel free to do it at [__Buy me a coffee! :coffee:__](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/codesqueak), and many thanks in advance.

For as we well know 

`var code = developer + caffeine`

:grin:

ps. Jam doughnut are also a perfectly acceptable sign of appreciation :doughnut:
